# ARBA: Returning to the Fundamentals of Search

Automation is the Engine, but Ad Rank is the Key. Master your Quality Score to unlock the full potential of your Search campaigns.

## The Reality of Modern Search

It is a common misconception that combining a larger budget with AI equals guaranteed wins. The reality is that automation without relevance is simply an expensive way to lose auctions faster. Tools like Broad Match and Exploration Bidding are built to find volume and coverage; they are not designed to fix poor quality.
The hard truth is that Ad Rank remains the gatekeeper. Google's auction continues to prioritize the user experience, meaning no amount of AI can bypass the core formula. You still have to fight for your impression.

## Your Formula for Visibility

Winning your auction requires aligning budget, targets, and exceptional quality. Here is the formula to capture demand and secure top positioning:

* **Uncapped Budget**: Maximise your potential and ensure funds don't limit your entry into auctions.
* **Unrestricted Target**: Relax your CPA or ROAS goals to allow for competitive bidding.
* **High Quality Score (7+)**: Deliver deep relevance and an outstanding user experience.
* **The Result**: When you combine these factors, you achieve your goal: Impression Share Won.

## How ARBA Solves the Problem

When your Quality Score is low, simply raising budgets or tweaking targets won't yield sustainable efficiency. ARBA identifies every reason your ads lose Impression Share, featuring a deep-dive focus on mastering your Quality Score. We pinpoint exactly where the problem is happening and what you can do to fix it.


## How ARBA Stands Out

* **Unified & Shareable**: Provides a fully automated, externally shareable dashboard. This offers a single view to identify all Ad Rank gaps with proactive daily or weekly updates.
* **Gemini AI Powered**: Leverages Gemini for deep analysis of USPs and CTAs. It also cross-checks popular keywords between your landing pages and active ads.
* **QS Structure Solutions**: Intelligently analyzes your account's search structure. It suggests changes to ensure keywords have sufficient data for accurate Quality Score calculation.


### Three Phases of Optimization

* **Diagnostic**: Analyse shifts in your spend, CPC, and impression share to detect timeline and auction changes.
* **Immediate Wins**: Execute fast actions to regain competitive edge, such as altering bids or increasing budgets to capture impression share.
* **Quality Score**: Move into deep optimization by following granular dashboard recommendations to drastically improve Ad Relevance and Landing Page Experience.


## Is ARBA Right For You?

ARBA is the ideal solution if any of the following apply to your campaigns:

* **Impression Share is a Key Metric**: You actively track Impression Share and Top Impression Share as primary KPIs to measure true brand visibility.
* **Uncapped Potential, Low Visibility**: Your account is not heavily budget or target-limited, but you still suffer from unusually low Impression Share.
* **Navigating Major Account Shifts**: You need a rigorous way to measure changes after significant updates, like launching fresh ad creatives, a new website, or a total account restructure.
* **Defending Brand Dominance**: You have active concerns about a decreasing trend in your Top Impression Share and need to protect your competitive standing.
